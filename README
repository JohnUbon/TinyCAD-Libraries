License Info:  Check out http://tinycad.sourceforge.net and the licensing info
for the libraries there.  It's the same. I did a fair bit of the artwork but 
not all of it.  If you want something removed because it violates a copyright, 
contact me. 

Background

These are the libraries I've created for TinyCAD.  TinyCAD is an open-source 
schematic editor tool that can be found here: http://tinycad.sourceforge.net 
I prefer a TinyCAD/FreePCB combo for my schematic and PCB layout needs, so 
these librares have parts with FreePCB footprints associated with them.  Some 
footprints are not present in FreePCB - that's because I made them and haven't 
had the time to add them to the Git repository yet.
