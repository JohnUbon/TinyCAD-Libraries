These are the libraries I've created for TinyCAD.  TinyCAD is an open-source schematic editor tool that can be found here: http://tinycad.sourceforge.net  I prefer a TinyCAD/FreePCB combo for my schematic and PCB layout needs, so these librares have parts with FreePCB footprints associated with them.  Some footprints are not present in FreePCB - that's because I made them and haven't had the time to add them to the Git repository yet!  I'm working on it.  Really.  I swear.  Ok not so much, but a little.  If I can just figure out how to use Git....
