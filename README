Warrany info:  There is none.  I mad these for my own purposes and thought that
others might like them as well.  They may not be right.  They probably aren't.  

License Info:  Check out http://tinycad.sourceforge.net and the licensing info
for the libraries there.  It's the same. I did a fair bit of the artwork but 
not all of it.  If you want something removed, contact me.  I have no desire to
infringe on any copyrights you can lay claim to - just tryin to help a few 
people out. 

Background

These are the libraries I've created for TinyCAD.  TinyCAD is an open-source 
schematic editor tool that can be found here: http://tinycad.sourceforge.net 
I prefer a TinyCAD/FreePCB combo for my schematic and PCB layout needs, so 
these librares have parts with FreePCB footprints associated with them.  Some 
footprints are not present in FreePCB - that's because I made them and haven't 
had the time to add them to the Git repository yet!  I'm working on it.  
Really.  I swear.  Ok not so much, but a little.  If I can just figure out how
to use Git....
