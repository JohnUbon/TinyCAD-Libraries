Warrany info:  There is none. These symbols aren't necessarily right, but I'm trying.
You can help me by finding bugs or submitting requests to the library tracker on
Sourceforge.net: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=47763&atid=1119064

License Info:  Check out http://tinycad.sourceforge.net and the licensing info
for the libraries there.  It's the same. I did a fair bit of the artwork but 
not all of it.  If you want something removed, contact me.  I have no desire to
infringe on any copyrights you can lay claim to - I'm just trying to help a few 
people out. 

Background

These are the libraries I've created for TinyCAD - and now they're the 
official libraries for the project! I keep this repository updated between
versions of TinyCAD and they should always pull from here when they release
a new version.

TinyCAD is an open-source schematic editor tool that can be found here: 
http://tinycad.sourceforge.net 

I prefer a TinyCAD/FreePCB combo for my schematic and PCB layout needs, so 
these librares have parts with FreePCB footprints associated with them.  Some 
footprints are not present in FreePCB - that's because I haven't made them yet!  
I'm working on it.  I swear.
